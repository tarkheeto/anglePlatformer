Gmae Idea:
You have a space base that you are trying to defend from a meteor shower
you have a canon that fires sequentially and you have to set the angle with the angle sensor 
the more meteors you hit the higher your score gets
the more you last the more difficult it gets 


we get a list of events from pygame so we have to go through them with a for loop

A Display surface is the canvas that gets drawn on
    there can only be one display surface

A surface is an image
    unlimited
    requires a display surface

blit : block image treansfer
    display_surface.blit(surface,position)
    top left position


Rectangle created from the surface


surf=Pygame.image.load('path')
rect=surf.get_rect(rect_pos)
inside the blit you essentially map the surface to the rectangle



Arduino Code Notes:

Rotating Clockwise:
    angle reading decreases

    Complete Revolution when angle gets to zero and is counted as a negative Revolution
    -ve number keeps getting larger until it reaches -180 then it jumps to 180 and keeps going towards zero


rotating anticlockwise:
    angle reading increases
    angle keeps increasing until it reaches 180 then immediately jumps to -180 then keeps increasing towards zero

there is a point at which the angle value jumps from -180 to 180


Plan: let the kit tell us whether there is a :

                                                 turn clockwise 
                                                 turn anticlockwise
