we get a list of events from pygame so we have to go through them with a for loop

A Display surface is the canvas that gets drawn on
    there can only be one display surface

A surface is an image
    unlimited
    requires a display surface

blit : block image treansfer
    display_surface.blit(surface,position)
    top left position


Rectangle created from the surface


surf=Pygame.image.load('path')
rect=surf.get_rect(rect_pos)
inside the blit you essentially map the surface to the rectangle
